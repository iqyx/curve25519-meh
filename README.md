A meh refactoring of TweetNaCl Curve25519.
==============================================


The original library was slightly obfuscated and hard to read. This is
the Curve25519 part required for ECDH computations extracted and refactored
from the code available at http://tweetnacl.cr.yp.to/20140427/tweetnacl.c

Based on the TweetNaCl library by Daniel J. Bernstein, Bernard van Gastel,
Wesley Janssen, Tanja Lange, Peter Schwabe and Sjaak Smetsers placed into
a public domain. More information can be found at http://tweetnacl.cr.yp.to/.
